              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">Once upon a time, a baby duckling is following its mother around the ECE 5725 town…but the duckling has a bad sense of direction. For this project, we plan to build two robots, consisting of one leader and one follower, to mimic the behavior of a mother duck and a baby duck. </p>

          <h2>Project Objective:</h2>
          <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">
            Our project features two robots, a leader and a follower, acting as a robotic mother duck🦆 and baby duck🐤. While the mother was moving, the baby carefully followed the mom but sometimes got “lost” and cried dramatically. The mother would then try to find the baby by color recognition with an equipped camera, like a tiny rescue mission. After the reunion, they ended up spinning and dancing happily together.

              <h2>Design</h2>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">The follower robot would follow the leader robot around and signal the leader via WiFi if it’s lost. The robot is considered lost if the distance measured is too large or if it’s been staring at a wall for 5 seconds. Once the leader robot receives the LOST signal, it would start seeking for the follower robot and send a FOUND signal upon discovery. Once the two robots are reunited, they would dance.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">The leader robot is equipped with a camera and uses the OpenCV library for color detection to seek for the follower robot. For debugging purposes, it also uses the PiTFT screen to display data and four buttons to perform different actions (seek, move, temp quit, full quit). The follower robot is equipped with 2 ultrasonic sensors to measure its distance from the leader robot and follow it around and 1 buzzer for audio cue.</p>

    <hr id='testing'>
    
      <div style="text-align:center;">
              <h2>Testing</h2>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">challenges encountered and how you resolved them? testing procedures and results verifying functionality</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">Humans life sucks, so does the duck.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">Since ducks need big ponds instead of cages, our robot ducks also demanded space, so we ran most experiments in the corridor outside the lab. In this “indoor wetland,” we discovered that other objects often had colors similar to the baby robot, which sometimes confused the mother's color-recognition camera and made her chase the wrong “duck.”</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">On the software side, the follower Pi Zero behaved like a stubborn duck that refused to wake up. When we used crontab for auto-start, the robot often stayed frozen after reboot, even though the same program worked perfectly when launched manually with a monitor attached. After switching to the second auto-start method from Lab 3 (using .bashrc), startup became much more reliable, and the baby robot finally began to follow its mom automatically after power-on.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">Networking added another layer of chaos. The IP addresses of both the mother and baby kept changing. It looked like they were migrating to a new lake every time we rebooted. We had to constantly look up the current IPs and update the program configuration before the two ducks could talk again. </p>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">Hardware was not innocent either. Loose power connections meant that the car sometimes stopped or refused to start at all, simply because the wiring between the battery pack / power bank and the Raspberry Pi or motor driver was unstable. We developed the habit of checking and securing all power cables before each test. At the same time, the ultrasonic sensors occasionally returned None, making the baby duck's distance judgment unreliable, so we increased the delay between reading the left and right sensors to get more stable measurements.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">Despite all the drama, most system functions eventually worked as intended. The baby normally follows the mom but can accidentally get lost; if it stares at a wall for more than 5 seconds, it sends a LOST signal to the mother. Initially, the baby was also spamming motor data for display on the PiTFT, which delayed LOST detection, but after removing those prints, the mom could recognize the LOST signal within about 1 second on average.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">When everything works, the mother calls the baby to dance, the baby receives the command and joins in, and the grown-up baby follows more smoothly while the once-careless mom turns more carefully. The duck family finally passes the test bench and survives another day in this “happy” human-built pond!</p>
      </div>

    <hr id='result'>

      <div style="text-align:center;">
              <h2>Result</h2>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">evaluate your outcomes, did your project perform as intended? did you meet your original goals and specifications?</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">In terms of communication, the duck family actually behaves better than most group chats. The bidirectional WiFi link between the leader and follower runs smoothly, with commands and LOST signals exchanged without any noticeable delay. From a system perspective, the network layer is stable and responsive enough that the “conversation” between mother and baby is not the main bottleneck of their behavior.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">On the motion and perception side, things are a bit more... bird-brained. The mother's color recognition works reliably, and she can plan a path toward the red-covered baby, but motor inconsistencies and the lack of an object-avoidance system mean her wandering is still clumsy and easily disrupted. The baby moves and measures distance correctly, with ultrasonic sensing behaving as expected, yet its following logic is underpowered: it tends to lose sight of the target and reacts too slowly when turning. In short, the ducks can see and talk just fine, which is a good start. They just haven't fully learned how to walk elegantly together.</p>

              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">key takeaways, what worked well, what did not work as expected</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">Communication: Bidirectional WiFi communication between the leader and follower robot work nicely without noticeable delay.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">Leader Robot: Color recognition works well, and it can plan a path to reach the red covered baby. However, due to motor inconsistencies and a lack of object avoidance system, it still struggles to wander around properly.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">Follower Robot: Movement works normally, and ultrasonic distance sensing is accurate, but the following behavior is weak as it often loses the target and turns too slowly.</p>
